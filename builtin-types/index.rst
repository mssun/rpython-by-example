Built-in Types
==============

Python provides various `built-in types <https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html>`_
such as numerics, sequences, mappings, files, classes, instance and exceptions.
Let's see how do these types behave in RPython. Note that, in this document, we
only focus on Python 2.7. The built-in types in Python 3 may be a little
different, but most of the types are same.
