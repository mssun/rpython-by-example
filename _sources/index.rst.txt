RPython By Example
==================

RPython is a language designed for producing implementations of dynamic
languages. The most notable one is PyPy, which is a fast alternative
implementation of the Python language. However, we thought the value of RPython
is far beyond that. In this doc, we will meet RPython language by several
examples, and compare the syntax with Python. At last, we wish you can have
a better understanding of the language, and hopefully, adopt it in many other
scenarios.

RPython by Example (RPyBE) is a collection of runnable examples that illustrate
various RPython concepts and libraries. RPyBE starts with a hello world example
and built-in types in RPython, then dives into RPython libraries, and build a
simple application at last.
