JIT
===

Simple Example
--------------

The following example is a interpreter of `brainfuck
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck>`_ language with JIT.
There is a detailed tutorial (`part1
<https://morepypy.blogspot.com/2011/04/tutorial-writing-interpreter-with-pypy.html>`_,
`part2 <https://morepypy.blogspot.com/2011/04/tutorial-part-2-adding-jit.html>`_) on
how to write a simple interpreter with RPython.
Here, we briefly introduce some JIT-related data structures, functions, and decorators.

.. literalinclude:: ../code/bf.py
   :linenos:

JitDriver
-------------

An interpreter wishing to use the RPython JIT generator must define a list of
green variables and a list of red variables. The green variables are loop
constants. They are used to identify the current loop. Red variables are for
everything else used in the execution loop.

JIT Decorators and Functions
----------------------------

* elidable
* hint
* promote
* promote_string
* dont_look_inside
* look_inside
* look_inside_iff
* unroll_safe
* loop_invariant
* elidable_promote
* oopspec
* not_in_trace
* isconstant
* isvirtual
* loop_unroll_heuristic
* we_are_jitted

JIT Parameters
--------------

* ``threshold``: number of times a loop has to run for it to become hot
* ``function_threshold``: number of times a function must run for it to become traced from start
* ``trace_eagerness``: number of times a guard has to fail before we start compiling a bridge
* ``decay``: amount to regularly decay counters by (0=none, 1000=max)
* ``trace_limit``: number of recorded operations before we abort tracing with ABORT_TOO_LONG
* ``inlining``: inline python functions or not (1/0)
* ``loop_longevity``: a parameter controlling how long loops will be kept before being freed, an estimate
* ``retrace_limit``: how many times we can try retracing before giving up
* ``max_retrace_guards``: number of extra guards a retrace can cause
* ``max_unroll_loops``: number of extra unrollings a loop can cause
* ``disable_unrolling``: after how many operations we should not unroll
* ``enable_opts``: internal use only (may not work or lead to crashes): optimizations
  to enable, or all = intbounds:rewrite:virtualize:string:pure:earlyforce:heap:unroll
* ``max_unroll_recursion``: how many levels deep to unroll a recursive function
* ``vec``: turn on the vectorization optimization (vecopt). Supports x86 (SSE 4.1), powerpc (SVX), s390x SIMD
* ``vec_cost``: threshold for which traces to bail. Unpacking increases the counter, vector operation decrease the cost,
* ``vec_all``: try to vectorize trace loops that occur outside of the numpypy library

The default parameters are:
