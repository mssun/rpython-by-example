Truth Value Testing
===================

The truth value testing of RPython is similar with Python.

Any object can be tested for truth value, for use in an if or while condition or
as operand of the Boolean operations below. The following values are considered
false:


* ``None``
* ``False``
* zero of any numeric type, for example, ``0``, ``0L``, ``0.0``.
* any empty sequence, for example, ``''``, ``()``, ``[]``.
* any empty mapping, for example, ``{}``.

All other values are considered true â€” so objects of many types are always true.

Operations and built-in functions that have a Boolean result always return ``0`` or
``False`` for false and 1 or ``True`` for true, unless otherwise stated. (Important
exception: the Boolean operations ``or`` and ``and`` always return one of their
operands.)

.. literalinclude:: ../code/truth_value_testing.py

.. attention::
  However, there is one inconsistency. In Python, the following values are
  considered *false*:

  * instances of user-defined classes, if the class defines a ``__nonzero__()`` or
    ``__len__()`` method, when that method returns the integer zero or ``bool`` value
    ``False``.

  In RPython, the above values are considered *true*.

For example, we have two classes: ``ZeroLen`` and ``NonZero``. They define
``__len__()`` and ``__nonzero__()`` methods respectively. Truth value testing of
instances of ``ZeroLen`` and ``NonZero`` are *different* in RPython and Python.

.. literalinclude:: ../code/truth_value_testing_inconsistency.py

However, the execution results are inconsistent using RPython and Python

.. code-block:: shell

    $ rpython truth_value_testing_inconsistency.py    # compile with RPython
    $ ./truth_value_testing_inconsistency-c
    zero_len is True in RPython.
    non_zero is True in RPython.

    $ python truth_value_testing_inconsistency.py    # interpret with Python
    zero_len is False in Python.
    non_zero is False in Python.
